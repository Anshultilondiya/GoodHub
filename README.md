# GoodHub
A community of programmers who work together to improve, learn, and stay motivated.

## What is GoodHub?
We are a community with a lot of activity and a lot of really Good people.
On GoodHub you will find like-minded people for whom programming is their passion, from beginners to experts.
We help each other on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/goodhub/shared_invite/zt-e13ge2c0-0Qrruah5eZ_1OfVNZpjsFA) to learn new programming languages, build projects, and motivation.

We are GLOBAL!

You will find answers to your questions, help others with your knowledge, share your personal projects, and discuss every smart topic.
The project and the courses provided by the mentor are free.
