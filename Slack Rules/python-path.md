## Python Path

# Why
The goal of a path is to avoid taking courses in an unstructured way, especially for beginner, risking losing interest and motivation.

# How
Depending on your level of preparation you will have to select and take a course, mentors and other students will be available on the channel to answer your questions and help you with the code.

# Who
Mentors personally recommend the courses, which are TOTALLY free and not sponsored. In this way it is possible for anyone to follow them and, thanks to the support of the group, to finish them with enthusiasm.

## Beginner

# Video Course
[SoloLearn Python Course](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/)
Completely free - only requires you sign up, and the site doesn't even verify your email - and even gives you a little certificate at the end, the value of this is up to you really though.

[LearnXInYMinutes page](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
A favorite of Rascal (main mentor) - like a quick refresher on entire topics, and the Python page isn't any different. Could even just use it itself to learn, although you wouldn't get the "why" behind many concepts.

# Text Course
[AutomateTheBoringStuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)
Completely free - but Rascal still recommend going through the SoloLearn course after whichever books you choose to get the full experience.

[HyperSkill's Python Track](https://hi.hyperskill.org)
It takes some time to get through, but covers more topics and in more detail then the SoloLearn course.

# Main Documentation
[Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

[DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io/python~3.8/)
Rascal reccomendation - These are useful for finding out what you don't know - like what methods a string has, or how to use the re regex module, etc.

[pythontutor.com](http://pythontutor.com/)
It allows you to visually see your program run, useful for algorithms and data structures.
