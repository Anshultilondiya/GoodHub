# How it all works?
The community is divided into two sections: study and project.
Those who want to make a project can use the relative channel (#web-dev or #language-dev) to find a friend and develop it, quickly and easily.
Those who want to study will have to subscribe to the reference programming language channel and will have to follow certain rules in order to make collaboration easier for everyone.

# Study section
Each channel will have multiple mentors (identifiable by an emoji next to their name), available to answer student's questions and help them study as efficiently as possible.
Based on the student's knowledge, specific paths to follow will be recommended, they are found in this folder in the files that bear the name of the channel such as "channelname-path.md".
Each student will have to follow these courses independently and they can ask any questions to the mentors or discuss with other students in the channel.
In this way there will be an always active group of people, ready to lend a hand.

The channels of the study section can also be used to ask general questions, as they are populated by people active on the programming languages ​​of reference.

# IMPORTANT!
In the "official-mentors.md" file you will find the list of mentors for each channel, these are the only official mentors.
