# React Path

## Why
React is by far the most popular [Javascript framework](https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/) and being used by many big companies like Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb & Reddit. The goal of this path is to make sure you are learning from the best and are not buried in tutorial hell.

## How
Depending on your preference select and take a course, mentors and other students will be available on the channel to answer your questions and help you with the code. Do not combine 2-3 courses at once pick a course you like and see it through to completion. After you have completed a course [start building a project](https://www.golangprograms.com/react-js-projects-for-beginners.html). Only when you can apply the stuff you have learnt can you say you know React.

## Who
Mentors personally recommend the courses, React being a intermediate skill level the courses courses mentioned are divided into free and paid. None of them are sponsored.

## Prerequisites
You need to be comfortable with the basics of Javascript and it's ES6 syntax as well as basic HTML. While many courses mentioned below don't need you to know JS, you won't build foundational knowledge without knowing how Javascript works.
